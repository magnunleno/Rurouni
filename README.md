Rurouni
=======

A layer over SQL Alchemy that provides automatic migrations.

The word rurouni actually doesn't exists in the Japanese vocabulary, is a
neologism created by Nobuhiro Watsuki (for the manga Rurouni Kenshin), using
the verb "ru" meaning "to wander" and "ronin" meaning "masterless samurai".  A
rough translation of the word would be a vagabond or vagrant/wandering samurai.

Since the main purpose of this project is to provide automatic database
migration this seams to be the perfect title.
